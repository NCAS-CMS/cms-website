## Archer2 O/S upgrade 

In May/June 2023, Archer2 underwent a [major software upgrade](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/faq/upgrade-2023/), with all the system software, including compilers and libraries being updated. As a result, we have had to rebuild much of the UM supporting software. This means users need to make some changes to their suites and test workflows before resuming work. 

We have ported and tested some of the commonly-used suites, listed below. And we have provided a guide to the changes required. As ever, since UM suites can be set up in so many different ways, we can not provide a comprehensive set of instructions. Please get in touch with the [helpdesk](https://cms-helpdesk.ncas.ac.uk/) if you run into diffculties.
