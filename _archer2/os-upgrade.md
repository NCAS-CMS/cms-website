In May/June 2023, Archer2 underwent a [major software upgrade](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/faq/upgrade-2023/). All the system software, including compilers and libraries were updated, and as a result, we have had to rebuild much of the UM supporting software. This means users need to make some changes to their suites and test their workflows before resuming work. 

We have ported and tested some of the commonly-used suites, listed below. And we have provided a guide to the suite changes required. As ever, since UM suites can be set up in so many different ways, we can not provide a comprehensive set of instructions. Please get in touch with the [helpdesk](https://cms-helpdesk.ncas.ac.uk/) if you run into diffculties.
