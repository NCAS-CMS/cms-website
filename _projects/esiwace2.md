The aim of ESiWACE2 is to prepare internationally leading European Earth system models for the next generation of high performance computing systems ("pre-exascale" and "exascale" systems) to be operated or developed in the EU. The efficient use of climate models on such exascale systems places enormous demands on the scalability and portability of the models and the data processing, a task that cannot be accomplished by individual institutions. ESiWACE2 provides a platform for the necessary interdisciplinary and international cooperation.
