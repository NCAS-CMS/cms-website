CF, i.e. the CF Conventions, is a netCDF convention which is in wide and growing use for the storage of model-generated and observational data relating to the atmosphere, ocean and Earth system.

The Python cf package, cf-python, is an Earth Science data analysis library. It is built on cfdm and implements the CF data model for its internal data structures so is able to process any CF-compliant dataset. It can read, write and inspect field constructs and manipulate the data and metadata therein by means of statistical operations, collapsing, subspacing, regridding and more. Field constructs from cf can also be visualised with the cf-plot package.

See the [cf-python documentation](https://ncas-cms.github.io/cf-python/) and/or the [cf-python GitHub repository](https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-python) for further information.
