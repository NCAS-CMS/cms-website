title: GA7.0/GA3.0 Standard Suites
teaser: Information and list of standard suites for the Global Coupled model configuration GC3.0 (GC3) and its components (Global Atmosphere 7 (GA7), Global Land 7 (GL7), Global Ocean 6 (GO6) and Global Sea Ice 8 (GSI8)).
---
In terms of new functionality, GA7 includes a new internally mixed aerosol scheme (UKCA GLOMAP-mode), GL7 includes a multi-layer snow scheme, GO6 extends the grid further to the south to allow the inclusion of an ice shelf model and GSI8 includes multi-layer ice thermodynamics. In addition, the component models contain a large number of improvements to their existing schemes that have been developed over the past few years to improve known model biases and the fidelity/consistency of the model's parametrisations. Assessment to date shows that these changes make improvements to all 4 "critical" model problems as identified in previous model assessment workshops.
