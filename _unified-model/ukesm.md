title: Introduction to UKESM1
teaser: UKESM1 is the first release of the UK Earth System Model. Built as a joint venture by the Met Office Hadley Centre and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UKESM1 consists of the HadGEM3 coupled physical climate model plus additional components that model key biogeochemical, chemistry, aerosol and vegetation processes.

More information about the contents and development of UKESM1 is available on the [UKESM website](https://ukesm.ac.uk/); in particular, the release and support of UKESM1 is described [here](https://ukesm.ac.uk/portfolio-item/release-and-support-of-ukesm1/) and [here](https://ukesm.ac.uk/portfolio-item/the-release-of-ukesm1-update/).

### Background and prerequisites

The model makes use of several scientific components, including the [Unified Model](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/unified-model) (UM) weather and climate modelling application.  See [here]({{site.baseurl}}/unified-model) for more on the UM.

UKESM1 is distributed and run as a [Rose](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/rose) suite; Rose is a framework for developing and running meteorological applications.  Some details about Rose are available [wiki:RoseCylc here].

The UKESM1 suites incorporate switches to choose the machine on which it is run; full details of how to do this are in the release notes - see [#UKESM1releasenotes below].  Available resources include [ARCHER2](http://www.archer2.ac.uk/), the UKRI platform, and [Monsoon2](http://www.jwcrp.org.uk/infrastructure/monsoon.asp), the Met Office / NERC collaborative platform.  Both are accessible from the [PUMA](puma-service).  See [wiki:Archer here] for more on Archer, and [wiki:MonsoonIntro here] for more about Monsoon (including how to get registered on these machines).

The UKESM1 suites are available from the [Met Office Science Repository Service](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/home/) (MOSRS).  Note that you must have a registered account to access this service.  If you are a NERC user, please [contact us](contact) to get one, otherwise please contact ''Scientific_Partnerships AT metoffice.gov.uk'' for advice about gaining access.

### UKESM1 release notes

The [UKESM1 release notes](RelNotes1.0) describe the different types of experiment which can be run using the model, how to access the suites, options for running the model (including selecting the target machine) and further configuration of the suites.  Note that these pages contain links to the MOSRS, which is only accessible to registered users (see [#Backgroundandprerequisites above]).
