Standard configurations are available either as example jobs in the UMUI or Rose suites in the MOSRS rosie-u repository. 

### HadGEM2

The HadGEM2 family of climate models represents the second generation of HadGEM configurations, with additional functionality including a well-resolved stratosphere and Earth System components.

### HadGEM3

The HadGEM3 family of models comprises a range of specific model configurations incorporating different levels of complexity but with a common physical framework. The HadGEM3 family includes a coupled atmosphere-ocean configuration, with or without a vertical extension in the atmosphere to include a well-resolved stratosphere, and an Earth-System configuration which includes dynamic vegetation, ocean biology and atmospheric chemistry.

###  UKESM1

[UKESM1](ukesm) is the first release of the UK Earth System Model.  Built as a joint venture by the Met Office Hadley Centre and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), UKESM1 consists of the HadGEM3 coupled physical climate model (see [#HadGEM3 above]) plus additional components that model key biogeochemical, chemistry, aerosol and vegetation processes.  More details about UKESM1 and how to access it are available [here](ukesm).
