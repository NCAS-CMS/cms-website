Standard configurations are available either as example jobs in the UMUI or Rose suites in the MOSRS rosie-u repository. 

### HadGEM3

The HadGEM3 family of models comprises a range of specific model configurations incorporating different levels of complexity but with a common physical framework. The HadGEM3 family includes a coupled atmosphere-ocean configuration, with or without a vertical extension in the atmosphere to include a well-resolved stratosphere, and an Earth-System configuration which includes dynamic vegetation, ocean biology and atmospheric chemistry.

[Global Atmosphere 7.0/Global Coupled 3.0](ga7.0-gc3.0)

[Global Atmosphere 8.0/Global Coupled 4.0](ga8.0-gc4.0)

###  UKESM

The [UK Earth System Model](ukesm) (UKESM) has been built as a joint venture between the Met Office Hadley Centre and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).  It consists of the HadGEM3 coupled physical climate model (see [above](#hadgem3)) plus additional components that model key biogeochemical, chemistry, aerosol and vegetation processes.  More details about UKESM and how to access it are available [here](ukesm).

### Performance

The performance of various standard configurations on ARCHER can be found on the [performance](/unified-model/performance/) page.
