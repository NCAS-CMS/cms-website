{% include alert info="Cylc 8 is still being tested on PUMA2 and ARCHER2. The software configuration is subject to change" %}

## Overview 

Cylc 8 replaces the Python 2 based Cylc 7 software. 
It is a complete rewrite in Python 3, and it works quite differently from Cylc 7, so we encourage you to look at the documentation. 
The user interface system is still being developed and does not yet have full functionality. 

Useful links: 
* [Cylc 8 documentation](https://cylc.github.io/cylc-doc/stable/html/index.html)
* [Cylc 7 to Cylc 8 migration guide](https://cylc.github.io/cylc-doc/stable/html/7-to-8/index.html)
* [Cylc discourse forum](https://cylc.discourse.group/) 

Note that in Cylc 8 terminology "suites" have become "workflows".
