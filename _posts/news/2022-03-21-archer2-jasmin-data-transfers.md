JASMIN have recently enabled the use of GridFTP with certificate authentication working.  This is now the recommended method for person-not-present data transfers and long running ARCHER2 suites and workflows.

Instructions on configuring the PPTransfer app for GridFTP within a UM suite is available here: [configuring pptransfer]({{ '/unified-model/pptransfer/' | relative_url }})

Full details on using GridFTP with certificates is available on the [JASMIN website](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4997-transfers-from-archer2)
