Initially we have transferred all *active* accounts to the new server.  You will have been contacted with login details if your account was in this group. 

If your account has not been reactivated please raise a query on the [CMS helpdesk](https://cms-helpdesk.ncas.ac.uk) asking for it to be transferred.
