Full details can be found on the [PUMA2 transition page]({{ '/puma2/' | relative_url }}), 
where you will find instructions for getting setup on PUMA2, 
including copying data, and moving over live suites.

Note that the old PUMA server will be unavailable during the 
[Jasmin downtime in October](https://www.ceda.ac.uk/blog/reminder-advance-notice-of-jasmin-power-maintenance-autumn-2023/) 
and will be decomissioned in due course. 

The UMUI is not yet operational on PUMA2, so please wait for further instructions.
