The n02 work disk continues to operate very near the project quota. 
This is unsustainable and is likely the cause of recent job slow-downs, see [Archer2 known issues](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/known-issues/#when-close-to-storage-quota-jobs-may-slow-down-or-produce-corrupted-files-added-2024-02-27). 

We all need to take action to reduce data volume or we will not be able to use the service. 
We have provided some advice for managing your disk space here: [https://cms.ncas.ac.uk/archer2/storage/](https://cms.ncas.ac.uk/archer2/storage/)
