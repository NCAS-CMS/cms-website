Following the ARCHER2 return to service NCAS-CMS will rebuild and reinstall software that we maintain. 
UM suites will not run until we have completed this work, please wait for an announcement from us before attempting to run UM suites. 

Further general information can be found on the ARCHER2 upgrade page: 
[https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/faq/upgrade-2023/#after-the-upgrade-process](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/faq/upgrade-2023/#after-the-upgrade-process)

Any changes that need to be made to UM suites will be added here as and when they become available.
