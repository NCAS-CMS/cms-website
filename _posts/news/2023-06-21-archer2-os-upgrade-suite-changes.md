Following the ARCHER2 OS Upgrade, NCAS-CMS have now rebuilt all software that we maintain centrally under ```$UMDIR```.

Before restarting UM suites there are a number of changes that users need to make to their suites.

These changes are detailed on our [ARCHER2 OS Upgrade]({{ '/archer2/os-upgrade/' | relative_url }}) page.
