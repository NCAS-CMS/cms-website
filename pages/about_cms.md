The main remit of CMS is to provide a range of services for the environmental modelling community, which include:

* Managing users and usage on national platform for the atmospheric and polar science consortium of the NERC HPC community.

* Managing infrastructure to support modelling workflows, including code managements systems, and job management and submission systems for the Unified Model.

* Assistance with porting models onto HPC platforms, including performance testing and bug fixes associated with compiler issues.

* Managing standard configurations of key model variants in significant usage on national platforms.

* Acquiring and/or generating ancillary, initial, and/or boundary data for key model variants.

* Running models and managing the data logistics for large and/or complex modelling programmes.

* Providing software engineering support ranging from bug fixing to the development of discrete modelling systems.

* Developing and maintaining bespoke utility software (including graphics packages) for the UK environmental modelling ecosystem.

* Delivering training for academic users of the Unified Model.

* Providing advice on HPC usage and procurement.
