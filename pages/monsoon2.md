### Introduction to the Monsoon service

Monsoon (previously referred to as MONSooN or Monsoon2) is the HPC hosted at the Met Office in Exeter and is a key piece of underpinning infrastructure for the Joint Weather and Climate Research Programme (JWCRP), a strategic partnership between the Met Office and NERC, which aims to improve collaboration between scientists funded by the two organisations by facilitating:

* Sharing of modelling results
* Joint development of software
* Access to Met Office data

The Monsoon service originally started on 1st December 2009 and ran until 2017.  In April 2017 a new contract was agreed to coincide with the new HPC being installed. 

The Monsoon service currently consists of:

* a 556 node Cray XC40 system, that is ~20,000 compute cores in total (The login nodes are an Ivybridge chip, the compute nodes a Broadwell chip)
* 1008 Tbytes of fast storage, for /home and /project disk areas
* a postprocessing (linux) system

Further information on Monsoon can be found in the [Monsoon2 User Guide](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/doc/monsoon2/index.html)
