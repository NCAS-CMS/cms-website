ARCHER2 is currently running as a small 4 cabinet early access system while the full system is being commissioned.

ARCHER2 will be an HPE Cray EX supercomputing system with an estimated peak performance of 28 PFLOP/s. The machine will have 5,848 compute nodes, each with dual AMD EPYC Zen2 (Rome) 64 core CPUs at 2.2GHz, giving 748,544 cores in total. Further details on the [ARCHER2 hardware](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/about/hardware.html) can be found on the [ARCHER2 website](https://www.archer2.ac.uk).

## Early Access 4-cabinet system

ARCHER users will find the new machine very familiar in many respects but with some important differences - see â€‹[ARCHER2 YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZi-oBdxoDV5CPEQnhmrCAg/videos) for a comprehensive array of presentations, in particular the one entitled [Differences between ARCHER and ARCHER2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmwGMk9uB-4).

CMS has installed and undertaken limited testing of several versions of the Unified Model and its auxiliary software. The process is ongoing - we encourage users where possible to migrate their workflows to use the latest versions of the UM.

Limitations of the 4-cabinet system may result in some constraints on the nature of workflows that it can accommodate.

**Scheduler:** \\
ARCHER2 uses the [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) scheduler.  All batch scripts run on ARCHER will need to be rewritten to work on ARCHER2.  See the ARCHER2 documentation for information on [running jobs on ARCHER2](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/user-guide/scheduler) and basic slurm commands.

**Login Nodes:** \\
The login nodes currently support the running of persistent ssh-agents enabling data transfer to JASMIN through the Rose/Cylc workflows.

**Compute Nodes:** \\
The compute nodes CANNOT see the `/home` filesystem.  Unlike ARCHER, batch scripts also run on the compute nodes. All files referenced in batch scripts and used by running jobs MUST be located on the `/work` file system.

**Serial Nodes:** \\
The 4-cabinet system DOES NOT have serial nodes.  Until the full-system comes online, which will have serial nodes, all data transfer tasks will need to run on the login nodes.

**File Systems:** \\
ARCHER2 has a `/home` and `/work` file system with identical structure to that on ARCHER.  The 4-cabinet system will have only 325TB on `/work` and 1.7TB on `/home`.  The full system will have substantially more.

**Budgets:** \\
The ARCHER2 budget structure and membership works in exactly the same way as for ARCHER2.  See the ARCHER2 documentation for information on [resources and how to check budgets](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/user-guide/scheduler/#resources).

## Getting an account on ARCHER2

To apply for an n02 project account please follow the instructions for [requesting an ARCHER2 login account](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/quick-start/quickstart-users/#request-an-account-on-archer2). 

## Unified Model on ARCHER2

CMS have installed the following versions of the UM on ARCHER2: 7.3, 8.4, 10.7, 11.1+

### Getting Started

Several setup steps are required before running the UM for the first time on ARCHER2:

For those that have never run the UM before:
* Register for an ARCHER2 account. ([See above](#getting-an-account-on-archer2))
* Register for a PUMA account by contacting the [CMS Team]({{ '/contact/' | relative_url}}).
* Setup your PUMA and ARCHER2 environments by following the [set up instructions](https://ncas-cms.github.io/um-training/getting-setup.html#set-up-your-archer2-environment) in our online training.

For those that have previously run the UM on ARCHER:
* Register for an ARCHER2 account. ([See above](#getting-an-account-on-archer2))
* Setup your ARCHER2 environment. Ensure you have the following line in your `~/.bash_profile` on ARCHER2: \\
  `. /work/y07/shared/umshared/bin/rose-um-env` \\
  **Note:** the path change from ARCHER.

### UMDIR (umshared)

All UM data and software is installed centrally under `/work/y07/shared/umshared`.

UKCA input files that used to be under `/work/n02/n02/ukca` on ARCHER now reside under `$UMDIR/ukca`.

Users may set `UMDIR` in their `~/.bash_profile` but remember that batch jobs can't see `/home` and therefore will not source any scripts that reside there.

### Standard Suites

CMS maintain a number of standard suite configuations on ARCHER2. All standard suites available are detailed on the [UM Configurations]({{ '/unified-model/configurations' | relative_url }}) page.

### Porting from ARCHER to ARCHER2

See the [porting page]({{ '/archer2/porting/' | relative_url }}) for instructions on how to port a UM suite or UMUI job to ARCHER2. Example suites that CMS have already ported can also be found on this page.
