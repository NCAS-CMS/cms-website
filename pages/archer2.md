ARCHER2 is an HPE Cray EX supercomputing system with an estimated peak performance of 28 PFLOP/s. The machine has 5,860 compute nodes, each with dual AMD EPYC 7742 64-core CPUs at 2.25GHz, giving 750,080 cores in total. Further details on the [ARCHER2 hardware](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/about/hardware.html) can be found on the [ARCHER2 website](https://www.archer2.ac.uk).

ARCHER users will find the new machine very familiar in many respects but with some important differences - see â€‹[ARCHER2 YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZi-oBdxoDV5CPEQnhmrCAg/videos) for a comprehensive array of presentations, in particular the one entitled ["Differences between ARCHER and ARCHER2"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmwGMk9uB-4).

CMS has installed and undertaken limited testing of several versions of the Unified Model and its auxiliary software. We encourage users where possible to migrate their workflows to use the latest versions of the UM.
