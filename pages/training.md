### Introduction to the Unified Model

NCAS-CMS organises 3-day workshops that introduce the UM infrastructure for UK research, to help new users past the initial steep learning curve usually involved with UM modelling. The Introduction to Unified Model course provides practical support for setting up and running UM experiments, through a series of short lectures and hands-on exercises.

Further details, including how to apply can be found on the [NCAS Website](https://ncas.ac.uk/study-with-us/introduction-to-unified-model/).

### Introduction to UKCA

The introduction to the UK Chemistry aerosol (UKCA) model course provides practical experience of running a community chemistry-aerosol climate model.  The UKCA model is based on the Met Office Unified Model and the atmospheric composition module of the UK Earth System Model.

Further details, including how to apply can be found on the [NCAS Website](https://ncas.ac.uk/study-with-us/introduction-to-ukca/).

Details on past UKCA training courses can be found on the [UKCA website](https://www.ukca.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/UKCA_Training_Overview).

### CF-Python and CF-Plot

This course will support Python users to read, analyse and plot atmospheric model data. 

Through talks and interactive sessions, you will master cf-python and cf-plot Python tools. These tools provide powerful extraction, regridding and visualisation capabilities, and make for quick analysis and data plotting.

Further details and how to apply can be found on the [NCAS website](https://ncas.ac.uk/study-with-us/data-analysis-tools/).
